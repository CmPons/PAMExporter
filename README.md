# PAMExporter
This is a simple export script for Asperite which creates Portable Arbitrary Map (PAM) image files. This exporter was written to learn how to write scripts for Asperite and might not fully conform to the PAM specification (https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html). At this time it also only supports exporting in a textbased human readable format.
